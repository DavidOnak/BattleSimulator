# Battle Simulator Game
A game application where you can battle different pokémon and level up while doing so to increase stats and learn new moves. 
Written in java and ultizes a GUI interface.

# Disclaimer
This game was modelled of the Pokémon games developed by Game Freak Inc. and published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo. Character's types and stats follow the pokémon games use and use similar equations for doing calculations for stat changes and damage.

# Saves Slots
This game uses the file directory saves that contain text files that store stats, moves, and unlock for the user. After the introduction screen, the user will be presented with a save slot screen that holds three saves, these are used by the jFrame implementing the scanner class for reading and writing to the text files.

# Move Selection
After making a new save, the user will be directed to the move selection screen, which can be accessed again in the future throught the main menue. This screen is made from rows of jButtons that are colour coded based on the moves type, with moves that the user has selected being grayed out. The user will not be able to leave the move selection screen until four moves has been selected (which can be reset by pressing the reset button) with the exception of viewing the the database screen which contains information on the moves.

There are special moves that will be disabled from selecting until they have been unlocked from doing battles and leveling up. Each five levels gained will unlock one of these moves at random which are more powerful moves then the default ones.
